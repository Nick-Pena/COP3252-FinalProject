COP3252 Final Project: Durak
======
Made by [Nicholas Pena](https://github.com/Nick-Pena) & [Evgeniya Kalashnikova](https://github.com/evginny).


We chose to create a Java version of Durak, a Russian card game. We exclusively used a mix of the Swing and AWT Java libraries for the game's GUI and event handling.
